/**
 * A single Lua 5.5 interpreter instance.
 *
 * A state is confined to the thread that created it; touching it from any
 * other thread throws [IllegalStateException]. [close] frees the underlying
 * `lua_State` and disposes every pinned host-function reference; using the
 * state (or any [LuaValue.Table]/[LuaValue.Function] handle it produced)
 * after `close()` throws [IllegalStateException].
 *
 * [LuaValue.Table] and [LuaValue.Function] handles are backed by references
 * in the Lua registry, so they remain valid across stack operations but stay
 * pinned until the state is closed. Holding very many handles therefore keeps
 * their Lua values alive until `close()`.
